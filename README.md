**Description**: 
**StudyMates!** will be a _mobile application_ with the primary function of helping the user focus on their task using the _pomodoro method_. 
A study mate, a pokemon-inspired concept, will be the main motivation to make the user study. The application will keep track of how long the user studies for in total and reward them for longer hours of study through in-game currency to decorate their study mate, i.e. buying cosmetics. The user can interact with their study mate and be able to play and take care of them like a virtual pet. 

**Developers**: 
Gabriela Alvarez, Cindy Do, Megan Miyazaki, Ashley Pham

**Tools Used**: 
React Native, Google Cloud Firebase (Authentication and Firestore NoSQL), NativeWind, StyleSheet API.

**Final Vision**: 
The final app will allow the user to adopt/take care of an in-game virtual pet that encourages the user to increase their focus. The user will be able to set a weekly focus goal they want to achieve. Each focus block, the user will be rewarded with coins. Coins can be used to buy cosmetic items or treats for their pet to improve their friendship.

We expect the app to be very heavily focused on its design of the menus, animations, and characters. The graphics of the game will be the main focus and appeal to the user.
